    HTTP Error handler -- implements nicer error pages

    You need to add/replace the following to your routes.py in web2py directory
    routes_onerror = [
        ('eden/400', '!'),
        ('eden/401', '!'),
        ('eden/509', '!'),
        ("eden/*", "/eden/errors/index"),
        ("*/*", "/eden/errors/index"),
    ]

    NOTE: if Eden is installed elsewhere or exists under different name in applications folder,
          just rename it in above list. Comment the last route to disable error
          catching for other apps in the same web2py environment
