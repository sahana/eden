Sahana Eden
===========

Sahana Eden is a rapid application development (RAD) kit for web-based, database-driven
humanitarian and emergency management applications.

Sahana Eden builds on the **web2py** web application framework, and is written in the
**Python** programming language (version 3.6+). It also uses *HTML5*, *JavaScript*,
and *SCSS* to generate web contents, as well as *XSLT* to handle certain data formats.
