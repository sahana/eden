Business Data Models
====================

The models implement data structures for specific business cases. Typically, they
have been developed for actual deployments, and then (often only partially)
generalized.

.. note::

   Some of these models may be under active development, and thus this
   documentation not always fully up-to-date - please study the current
   code before planning your project.
