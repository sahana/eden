Content Management
==================

The Content Management System (*cms*) is a place to store all kinds of
user-editable contents. Its main entity is the **Post** (=content item),
which can be linked to various :doc:`core entities <../core/index>`.
Posts are also *DocEntities*, i.e. can have attachments.

The CMS was originally designed for news and discussion feeds, but is
more commonly used for informative page contents including, but not
limited to:

   - page intros
   - legal, contact and privacy information pages
   - guidance on forms or form elements
   - group announcements
   - online user guides

...as well as for notification templates.
