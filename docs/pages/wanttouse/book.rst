Updates
----------------
The book is editable using  Booki. Note that whilst this is freely open, it should not be treated like a Wiki. The book content should be of a higher quality with complete sentences/paragraphs which flow smoothly as opposed to short notes or lists. Please do help by fixing any spelling/grammar errors in the book, improve the flow and add further clarification where needed. If you want to add new content, use the Wiki for rough notes & then draft new chapters in the 'Hold chapters' section. If you would like to change Sections or add a new Chapter please send an email to the sahana-eden mailing list so that this can be discussed in the community first. The 'Sahana Eden Book Editor' will review edits & push updates to both Floss Manuals & Lulu.
