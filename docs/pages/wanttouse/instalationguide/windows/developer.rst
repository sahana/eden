WINDOWS - DEVELOPER
===================

As a Developer running Windows, you have 3 choices:

- Install Python & all dependent libraries using a simplified installer: `InstallationGuidelines/Windows/Developer/Installer <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/Windows/Developer/Installer>`_

- Install Python & all libraries manually: `InstallationGuidelines/Windows/Developer/Manual <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/Windows/Developer/Manual>`_   *This option -- installing directly on your machine -- takes longer, but allows getting the latest versions of tools and packages. It may be a better choice if you are interested in doing long-term Eden development.*

- Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ & run a  `Virtual Machine <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/VirtualMachine>`_ which includes a pre-configured Eclipse on an Ubuntu OS. *This is appropriate for getting started quickly -- e.g. if you're participating in a codeathon, or are deploying Eden in an actual event and need to make changes -- as browser and IDE setup has been done. The virtual machine itself will need some setup.*
