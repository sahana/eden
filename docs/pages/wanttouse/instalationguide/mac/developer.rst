MAC - DEVELOPER
************************

As a Developer using a Mac, you have 2 choices:

- Install Apple compiler tools, Python, and all libraries manually: `InstallationGuidelines/Mac/Developer/Manual <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/Mac/Developer/Manual>`_ *This option -- installing directly on your machine -- takes longer, but allows getting the latest versions of tools and packages. It may be a better choice if you are interested in doing long-term Eden development.*

- Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ & run a `Virtual Machine <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/VirtualMachine>`_ which includes a pre-configured Eclipse on an Ubuntu OS *This is appropriate for getting started quickly -- e.g. if you're participating in a codeathon, or are deploying Eden in an actual event and need to make changes -- as browser and IDE setup has been done. The virtual machine itself will need some setup. The virtual machine itself will need some setup. The virtual machine desktop is currently limited to a rather small window -- it cannot currently be resized nor made full-screen.*
