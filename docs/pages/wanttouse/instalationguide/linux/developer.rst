LINUX - DEVELOPER
************************

As a Developer running Linux, you have 3 choices:

- Install Python and all libraries using a `Script <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/Linux/Developer/Script>`_ (Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora only currently).
- Install Python and all libraries `Manually <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/Linux/Developer/Manual>`_ .

*This option -- installing directly on your machine -- takes longer than the Virtual Machine, but allows getting the latest versions of tools and packages. It may be a better choice if you are interested in doing long-term Eden development.*

- Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ & run a  `Virtual Machine <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/VirtualMachine>`_ which includes a pre-configured Eclipse on an Ubuntu OS .

*This is appropriate for getting started quickly -- e.g. if you're participating in a codeathon, or are deploying Eden in an actual event and need to make changes -- as browser and IDE setup has been done. The virtual machine itself will need some setup.*
