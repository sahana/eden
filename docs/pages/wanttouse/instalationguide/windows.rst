Different instructions are available, depending on what type of user you are:

- :doc:`./wanttouse/instalationguide/windows/developer`

- :doc:`./wanttouse/instalationguide/windows/end-user` *Not currently maintained*

Note: We don't currently recommend installing Multi-user versions on Windows servers, although there should be nothing stopping this being possible either using Apache & MySQL or `IIS <http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelinesIIS>`_ & SQL Server.
