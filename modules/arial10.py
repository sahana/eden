'''
Character width dictionary and convenience functions for column sizing
with xlwt when Arial 10 is the standard font.  Widths were determined
experimentally using Excel 2000 on Windows XP.  I have no idea how well
these will work on other setups.  For example, I don't know if system
video settings will affect the results.  I do know for sure that this
module won't be applicable to other fonts in general.

# By default, Excel displays column widths in units equal to the width
# of '0' (the zero character) in the standard font.  For me, this is
# Arial 10, but it can be changed by the user.  The BIFF file format
# stores widths in units 1/256th that size.
#
# Within Excel, the smallest incrementable amount for column width
# is the pixel.  However many pixels it takes to draw '0' is how many
# increments there are between a width of 1 and a width of 2.  A
# request for a finer increment will be rounded to the nearest pixel.
# For Arial 10, this is 9 pixels, but different fonts will of course
# require different numbers of pixels, and thus have different column
# width granularity.
#
# So far so good, but there is a wrinkle.  Excel pads the first unit
# of column width by 7 pixels.  At least this is the padding when the
# standard font is Arial 10 or Courier New 10, the two fonts I've tried.
# It don't know if it's different for different fonts.  For Arial 10,
# with a padding of 7 pixels and a 9-pixel-wide '0', this results in 16
# increments to get from width 0 (hidden) to width 1.  Ten columns of
# width 1 are 160 pixels wide while five columns of width 2 are 125
# pixels wide.  A single column of width 10 is only 97 pixels wide.
#
# The punch line is that pixels are the true measure of width, and
# what Excel reports as the column width is wonky between 0 and 1.
# The only way I know to find out the padding for a desired font is
# to set that font as the standard font in Excel and count pixels.
