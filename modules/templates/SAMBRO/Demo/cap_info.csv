Ferry services were shut down and some seaside communities were warned they could be swamped by large waves as the typhoon approached, officials said.

""Our advice is for people on the eastern seaboard to avoid outdoor activities,"" state weather forecaster Fernando Cada told AFP, while adding there was a possibility the typhoon could weaken as it nears land.

Storm surges -- tsunami-like waves generated by powerful typhoons -- that could reach 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in height are forecast in Cordillera province and two other areas of Luzon, he added.

He said heavy rain that could trigger floods and landslides was also forecast near the eye of the typhoon, which is forecast to veer northeast towards southern Taiwan after running into Luzon's mountain ranges.

The coastguard said it has shut down ferry services on the threatened areas, leaving nearly 8,000 commuters stranded at ports according to a tally by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.","""Alert"" means you should prepared and be vigiland observing the situation.
