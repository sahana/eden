<h1>About Map the Philippines</h1>
<p>
Map the Philippines (MapPH) is an international community
working together with free mapping tools to help citizens,
NGOs, business, schools, and government work better together
to strengthen the resilience of our cities.
</p>
<p>
MapPH is a free and open source, open data platform that maps
real time community needs, tracks public and private programs
and services, and layers risk data to help achieve the
<a href=""http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/"" target=""_blank"">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>.
</p>
<p>
We teach communities how to map with free mapping tools and
how to report public and private sector needs. By layering
data, we help visualize priorities, overlaps and gaps, to help
stakeholders make more informed decisions about our communities.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to map all 81 provinces to December 2017.
