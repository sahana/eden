        Custom Application Main Menu:

        The main menu consists of several sub-menus, each of which can
        be customised separately as a method of this class. The overall
        composition of the menu is defined in the menu() method, which can
        be customised as well:

        Function        Sub-Menu                Access to (standard)

        menu_modules()  the modules menu        the Eden modules
        menu_admin()    the Admin menu          System/User Administration
        menu_lang()     the Language menu       Selection of the GUI locale
        menu_auth()     the User menu           Login, Logout, User Profile
        menu_help()     the Help menu           Contact page, About page

        The standard uses the MM layout class for main menu items - but you
        can of course use a custom layout class which you define in layouts.py.

        Additional sub-menus can simply be defined as additional functions in
        this class, and then be included in the menu() method.

        Each sub-menu function returns a list of menu items, only the menu()
        function must return a layout class instance.
