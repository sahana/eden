Homepage,default,index,"<h2>Support Cumbria</h2><p>Support Cumbria is a collaboration of agencies and communities within the County of Cumbria to offer support during a major incident at a community level.</p><p>Cumbria appreciates and is thankful to all those wishing to volunteer their time, offer accommodation, offer donated goods or wish to raise money to support those affected. The greatest benefit is felt through a coordinated response with preparation. Impacts and consequences of a Major Incident on people’s lives can be devastating and wide ranging.</p><p>Disaster appeals are a way in which the public and businesses can support those impacted through allowing the individual to decide what is needed. Financial support allows people to make decisions and some control over the impacts. In Cumbria there is a partnership with Cumbria Community Foundation who will assist with processing disaster funds. Cumbria Community Foundation is part of a national and international network of community foundations.  Together we seek to support people and organisations wishing to invest in the local community. If a disaster fund is established you will be able to find details on how to donate on their Website: <a href='https://www.cumbriafoundation.org'>https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/</a></p><p>Other ways to support communities during a major incident is to donate items or volunteer your time.</p>"
Volunteer1,default,Volunteer1,"<h2>Volunteering Your Time</h2><p>If you have been interested in volunteering in your local area, your Local Volunteer Council can show you opportunities. In Cumbria you can find information on how you can make a difference from the Cumbria Council for Voluntary Service.</p><p>If you are particularly interested in Major Incident Response there are many local Community Resilience Groups in Cumbria to volunteer with or the British Red Cross have a Community Reserve Volunteer Scheme. The community reserve volunteer program is a new volunteering opportunity allowing you to make a difference during a flood, fire or any other major emergency near you. Sign up today and take the first step towards being prepared in a crisis.</p><p><a href='https://reserves.redcross.org.uk'>https://reserves.redcross.org.uk/</a></p><p>Although we understand you might be keen travel to the affected area as soon as possible offer assistance, routes need to be kept clear for emergency services vehicles and personnel.</p><p>You can also register to join the Cumbria Reserve Volunteers below. Your details will be held on a secure database and you will be contacted directly by Agencies, Community Groups or other third Sector Organisations working on the incident who need extra support.</p><p>It is also important to remember that a sustained volunteering effort will be required to help people recover from a major incident and often there is more need for volunteers in the weeks following an incident.</p>"
Volunteer2,default,Volunteer2,"<h3>Self Deployment</h3><p>Many people who are local to an incident may wish to consider attending the scene to see if they can help, or offer to assist neighbours of local residents. This is called self-deployment and falls outside of the co-ordinated response. You need to consider your own and others' safety as you do not fall under the insurance of responding organisations.</p><p>We ask you not to self-deploy and any self-deployment in the affected area is done so at your own risk.</p>"
Donate1,default,Donate1,"<h2>Donating items</h2><p>In the first instance it is paramount that people's safety is the first consideration, and therefore it is difficult to also accommodate storage of items, however assisting people to rebuild their lives is important and you might want to consider the following:</p><p><b>Have a think about what items may be needed once a community starts to move towards recovery from an incident?</b></p><p>Please remember that some of these items won’t be needed for some time and people may be living away from home and be unable to store them.</p><p>Donations of the following items, equipment or services may be useful for those affected:</p><ul><li>Furniture</li><li>Domestic Supplies (such as cleaning)</li><li>Bedding</li><li>Catering</li><li>White Goods</li><li>Transportation Assistance</li><li>Personal Care Items (mobility and hygiene)</li></ul>"
Donate2,default,Donate2,"<h3>What condition should items be in?</h3><p>The condition of items often depends on the type of items being offered but below are a few key points you may wish to consider:</p><ul><li>Clothing - Consider raising money so those affected can choose clothing that is appropriate to their needs and fits. This can be important dealing with the well being of those affected.</li><li>Furniture - Think about 'saleable' condition as a bench mark.</li><li>Soft Furnishing - It is important that these meet the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988.</li><li>Soft Toys and Games - Please ensure these are in excellent condition and complete, and meet the British Standards Kitemark.</li><li>Cleaning Products/Equipment - These need to be sealed and in original packaging to ensure any irritants and usage instructions are clearly available.</li></ul>"
