Homepage,default,index,"<h2>Support Cumbria</h2><p>Support Cumbria is a collaboration of agencies and communities within the County of Cumbria to offer support during a major incident at a community level.</p><p>Cumbria appreciates and is thankful to all those wishing to volunteer their time, offer accommodation, offer donated goods or wish to raise money to support those affected. The greatest benefit is felt through a coordinated response with preparation. Impacts and consequences of a Major Incident on people’s lives can be devastating and wide ranging.</p><p>Disaster appeals are a way in which the public and businesses can support those impacted through allowing the individual to decide what is needed. Financial support allows people to make decisions and some control over the impacts. In Cumbria there is a partnership with Cumbria Community Foundation who will assist with processing disaster funds. Cumbria Community Foundation is part of a national and international network of community foundations.  Together we seek to support people and organisations wishing to invest in the local community. If a disaster fund is established you will be able to find details on how to donate on their Website: <a href='https://www.cumbriafoundation.org'>https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/</a></p><p>Other ways to support communities during a major incident is to donate items or volunteer your time.</p>"

Your details will be held on a secure database and you will be contacted directly by Agencies, Community Groups or other third Sector Organisations working on the incident who need extra support.</p><p>It is also important to remember that a sustained volunteering effort will be required to help people recover from a major incident and often there is more need for volunteers in the weeks following an incident.</p>"
Volunteer3,default,Volunteer3,"<h3>Self Deployment</h3><p>Many people who are local to an incident may wish to consider attending the scene to see if they can help, or offer to assist neighbours of local residents. This is called self-deployment and falls outside of the co-ordinated response. You need to consider your own and others' safety as you do not fall under the insurance of responding organisations.</p><p>We ask you not to self-deploy and any self-deployment in the affected area is done so at your own risk.</p><p>Although we understand you might be keen travel to the affected area as soon as possible to offer assistance, but routes need to be kept clear for emergency services vehicles and personnel.</p>"
