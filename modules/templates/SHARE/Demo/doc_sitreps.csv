Galle, Kalutara, Matara and Ratnapura were identified as the worst affected districts. Since the launch of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) Emergency Response Plan, the Disaster Management Centre has confirmed that 213 people have been killed. Humanitarian needs including access to safe, clean water for drinking and household use, and ensuring the safety of temporary shelters for displaced people remain key priorities. Humanitarian agencies continue to work alongside local partners to address the needs of affected communities, and are ensuring that their activities complement the Government of Sri Lanka at the national and sub-national levels."
