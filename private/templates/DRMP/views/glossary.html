<h3>Biological hazard</h3>  <p>Examples of biological hazards: outbreaks of epidemic diseases, plant or animal contagion, insect plagues and extensive infestations.</p>
    <p>Examples of biological hazards: outbreaks of epidemic diseases, plant or animal contagion, insect plagues and extensive infestations.</p>
<h3>Building codes</h3> <p>Ordinances and regulations controlling the design, construction, materials, alteration and occupancy of any structure to insure human safety and welfare. Building codes include both technical and functional standards.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>   <p>A combination of all the strengths and resources available within a community, society or organisation that can reduce the level of risk, or the effects of a disaster. </p>
    <p>Capacity may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personal or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Capacity may also be described as capability.</p>
<h3>Capacity building</h3>  <p>Efforts aimed to develop human skills or societal infrastructures within a community or organisation needed to reduce the level of risk. </p>
    <p>In extended understanding, capacity building also includes development of institutional, financial, political and other resources, such as technology at different levels and sectors of the society.</p>
<h3>Climate change </h3>    <p>The climate of a place or region is changed if over an extended period (typically decades or longer) there is a statistically significant change in measurements of either the mean state or variability of the climate for that place or region. </p>
    <p>Changes in climate may be due to natural processes or to persistent anthropogenic changes in atmosphere or in land use. Note that the definition of climate change used in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is more restricted, as it includes only those changes, which are attributable directly or indirectly to human activity.</p>
<h3>Community </h3> <p>In the context of disaster risk management, a community can be defined as people living in one geographical area, who are exposed to common hazards due to their location. They may have common experience in responding to hazards and disasters. However, they may have different perception of and exposure to risk. Groups within the locality will have a stake in risk reduction measures (either in favour or against)</p>
<h3>Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) </h3>  <p>A process of disaster risk management in which at-risk communities are actively engaged in the identification, analysis, treatment, monitoring and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and enhance their capacities. This means the people are at the heart of decision-making and implementation of disaster risk management activities. The involvement of the most vulnerable is paramount and the support of the least vulnerable is necessary. In CBDRM, local and national governments are involved and supportive (ADPC-CBDRM-11, 2003).</p>
<h3>Counter measures</h3>   <p>All measures taken to counter and reduce disaster risk. They most commonly refer to engineering (structural) measures but can also include non-structural measures and tools designed and employed to avoid or limit the adverse impact of natural hazards and related environmental and technological disasters.</p>
<h3>Disaster</h3>   <p>A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. </p>
    <p>A disaster is a function of the risk process. It results from the combination of hazards, conditions of vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential negative consequences of risk.</p>
<h3>Disaster risk management</h3>   <p>The systematic process of using administrative decisions, organisation, operational skills and capacities to implement policies, strategies and coping capacities of the society and communities to lessen the impacts of natural hazards and related environmental and technological disasters.</p>
    <p>This comprises all forms of activities, including structural and non-structural measures to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) adverse effects of hazards.</p>
<h3>Disaster risk reduction (disaster reduction)</h3>   <p>The conceptual framework of elements considered with the possibilities to minimise vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development. </p>
    <p>The disaster risk reduction framework is composed of the following fields of action (as described in ISDR's publication 2002 "Living with Risk: a global review of disaster reduction initiatives", page 23): </p>
    <p><ul><li>Risk awareness and assessment including hazard analysis and vulnerability/capacity analysis; </li><li>Knowledge development including education, training, research and information; </li><li>Public commitment and institutional frameworks, including organizational, policy, legislation and community action; </li><li>Application of measures including environmental management, land-use and urban planning, protection of critical facilities, application of science and technology, partnership and networking, and financial instruments; </li><li>Early warning systems including forecasting, dissemination of warnings, preparedness measures and reaction capacities. </li></ul></p>
<h3>Early warning </h3> <p>The provision of timely and effective information, through identified institutions, that allows individuals exposed to a hazard to take action to avoid or reduce their risk and prepare for effective response. </p>
    <p>Early warning systems include a chain of concerns, namely: understanding and mapping the hazard; monitoring and forecasting impending events; processing and disseminating understandable warnings to political authorities and the population, and undertaking appropriate and timely actions in response to the warnings. </p>
    <p>In the conflict management sector, early warning is a product of an 'Analysis to Action System' that is conceptualized as a comprehensive and integrated end-to-end risk management system that allows communities, states and international community to make informed decisions and actions to mitigate conflict and disasters. Analysis to Action is applied in this Policy as a mechanism to manage integrated disaster, conflict and climate change risk. </p>
<h3>El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO)</h3>    <p>A complex interaction of the tropical Pacific Ocean and the global atmosphere that results in irregularly occurring episodes of changed ocean and weather patterns in many parts of the world, often with significant impacts, such as altered marine habitats, rainfall changes, floods, droughts, and changes in storm patterns. </p>
    <p>The El Nino part of ENSO refers to the well-above-average ocean temperatures along the coasts of Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile and across the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, while the Southern Oscillation refers to the associated global patterns of changed atmospheric pressure and rainfall. La Nina is approximately the opposite condition to El Nino. Each El Nino or La Nina episode usually lasts for several seasons.</p>
<h3>Emergency management </h3>  <p>The organisation and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, in particularly preparedness, response and rehabilitation. Emergency management involves plans, structures and arrangements established to engage the normal endeavours of government, voluntary and private agencies in a comprehensive and coordinated way to respond to the whole spectrum of emergency needs. This is also known as disaster management.</p>
    <p></p>
<h3>Environmental degradation</h3>  <p>The reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives and needs. Potential effects are varied and may contribute to an increase in vulnerability and the frequency and intensity of natural hazards.</p>
    <p>Some examples: land degradation, deforestation, desertification, wildland fires, loss of biodiversity, land, water and air pollution, climate change, sea level rise and ozone depletion.</p>
<h3>Evaluation </h3>    <p>The assessment of results and impact of a project in order to see to what extent the project objectives have been achieved.</p>
    <p>Mid-term evaluation is done to analyze the project halfway and if necessary make some adjustment or changes. Terminal evaluation is undertaken to determine whether the overall purpose of the project is reached.</p>
<h3>Forecast</h3>   <p>Definite statement or statistical estimate of the occurrence of a future event (UNESCO, WMO).</p>
    <p>This term is used with different meanings in different disciplines.</p>
<h3>Geological hazard</h3>  <p>Natural earth processes or phenomena that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. </p>
    <p>Geological hazard includes internal earth processes or tectonic origin, such as earthquakes, geological fault activity, tsunamis, volcanic activity and emissions as well as external processes such as mass movements: landslides, rockslides, rock falls or avalanches, surfaces collapses, expansive soils and debris or mud flows.</p>
    <p>Geological hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects.</p>
<h3>Geographic information systems (GIS)</h3>   <p>Analysis that combine relational databases with spatial interpretation and outputs often in the form of maps. A more elaborate definition is that of computer programs for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, analysing and displaying data about the earth that is spatially referenced. </p>
    <p>Geographical information systems are increasingly being utilised for hazard and vulnerability mapping and analysis, as well as for the application of disaster risk management measures.</p>
<h3>Goal group</h3> <p>Goal group is a segment of a population sharing characteristics relevant to a specific issue or the object of a given information campaign. Goal groups can be defined, among other categories, by the level of fear or professional affiliation. Ideally, for maximum effect, each specifically identified and defined goal group should be the target of separate, tailor-made messages. </p>
<h3>Hazard</h3> <p>A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. </p>
    <p>Hazards can include latent conditions that may represent future threats and can have different origins: natural (geological, hydrometeorological and biological) or induced by human processes (environ-mental degradation and technological hazards). Hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. Each hazard is characterised by its location, intensity, frequency and probability.</p>
<h3>Hazard analysis</h3>    <p>Identification, studies and monitoring of any hazard to determine its potential, origin, characteristics and behaviour.</p>
<h3>Hydrometeorological hazards</h3>    <p>Natural processes or phenomena of atmospheric, hydrological or oceanographic nature, which may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. </p>
    <p>Hydrometeorological hazards include: floods, debris and mud floods; tropical cyclones, storm surges, thunder/hailstorms, rain and wind storms, blizzards and other severe storms; drought, desertification, wildland fires, temperature extremes, sand or dust storms; permafrost and snow or ice avalanches. Hydrometeorological hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects.</p>
    <p></p>
<h3>La Nina </h3>   <p>See El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</p>
<h3>Land-use planning </h3> <p>Branch of physical and socio-economic planning that determines the means and assesses the values or limitations of various options in which land is to be utilised, with the corresponding effects on different segments of the population or interests of a community taken into account in resulting decisions. </p>
    <p>Land-use planning involves studies and mapping, analysis of environmental and hazard data, formulation of alternative land-use decisions and design of a long-range plan for different geographical and administrative scales.</p>
    <p>Land-use planning can help to mitigate disasters and reduce risks by discouraging high-density settlements and construction of key installations in hazard-prone areas, control of population density and expansion, and in the siting of service routes for transport, power, water, sewage and other critical facilities.</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3> <p>Structural and non-structural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impact of natural hazards, environmental degradation and technological hazards.</p>
<h3>Monitoring </h3>    <p>The continuous or periodic review and overseeing by stakeholders of the implementation of an activity, to ensure that input deliveries, work schedules, target outputs are proceeding according to plan.</p>
<h3>Natural hazards</h3>    <p>Natural processes or phenomena occurring in the biosphere that may constitute a damaging event. </p>
    <p>Natural hazards can be classified by origin namely: geological, hydrometeorological or biological. Hazardous events can vary in magnitude or intensity, frequency, duration, area of extent, speed of onset, spatial dispersion and temporal spacing.</p>
<h3>Preparedness</h3>   <p>Activities and measures taken in advance to ensure effective response to the impact of hazards, including the issuance of timely and effective early warnings and the temporary evacuation of people and property from threatened locations.</p>
<h3>Prevention</h3> <p>Activities to provide outright avoidance of the adverse impact of hazards and means to minimise related environmental, technological and biological disasters. </p>
    <p>Depending on social and technical feasibility and cost/benefit considerations, investing in preventive measures is justified in areas frequently affected by disasters. In the context of public awareness and education related to disaster risk reduction, changing attitudes and behaviour contributes to promoting a “culture of prevention”.</p>
<h3>Project</h3>    <p>An organised social process involving the provision of inputs (cash, labour, technology, methodology) over a defined period of time to implement activities and generate outputs or results, to achieve a previously defined objective or purpose and desired development goal (impact/effect).</p>
<h3>Project planning</h3>   <p>Sequencing of tasks to achieve the project objectives through timely project implementation and ensuring efficient use of resources. It includes determining tasks, benchmarks of achievements, assigning responsibilities, developing a timetable based on activities, and determining resource allocation and timing.</p>
<h3>Public awareness</h3>   <p>The processes of informing the general population, increasing levels of consciousness about risks and how people can act to reduce their exposure to hazards.</p>
    <p>This is particularly important for public officials in fulfilling their responsibilities to save lives and property in the event of a disaster. </p>
    <p>Public awareness activities foster changes in behaviour leading towards a culture of risk reduction. This involves public information, dissemination, education, radio or television broadcasts, use of printed media, as well as the establishment of information centres and networks and community and participation actions.</p>
<h3>Public information</h3> <p>Information, facts and knowledge provided or learned as a result of research or study, available to be disseminated to the public.</p>
<h3>Recovery</h3>   <p>Decisions and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restoring or improving the pre-disaster living conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk.</p>
    <p>Recovery (rehabilitation and reconstruction) affords an opportunity to develop and apply disaster risk reduction measures.</p>
<h3>Relief/response</h3>    <p>The provision of assistance or intervention during or immediately after a disaster to meet the life preservation and basic subsistence needs of those people affected. It can be of an immediate, short-term, or protracted duration.</p>
<h3>Resilience/resilient</h3>   <p>The capacity of a system, community or society potentially exposed to hazards to adapt, by resisting or changing in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning and structure. This is determined by the degree to which the social system is capable of organising itself to increase its capacity for learning from past disasters for better future protection and to improve risk reduction measures.</p>
<h3>Risk </h3>  <p>The probability of harmful consequences, or expected losses (deaths, injuries, property, livelihoods, economic activity disrupted or environment damaged) resulting from interactions between natural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions. </p>
    <p>Conventionally risk is expressed by the notation </p>
    <p>Risk = Hazards x Vulnerability. Some disciplines also include the concept of exposure to refer particularly to the physical aspects of vulnerability. </p>
    <p>Beyond expressing a possibility of physical harm, it is crucial to recognise that risks are inherent or can be created or exist within social systems. It is important to consider the social contexts in which risks occur and that people therefore do not necessarily share the same perceptions of risk and their underlying causes.</p>
<h3>Risk assessment/analysis</h3>   <p>A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that could pose a potential threat or harm to people, property, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend. </p>
    <p>The process of conducting a risk assessment is based on a review of both the technical features of hazards such as their location, intensity, frequency and probability; and also the analysis of the physical, social, economic and environmental dimensions of vulnerability and exposure, while taking particular account of the coping capabilities pertinent to the risk scenarios.</p>
<h3>Risk communication </h3>    <p>Risk communication is a critical component of the risk management process targeted to the provision of information to the public, which will reduce fear and anxiety before, during and after the hazard impact. </p>
    <p>A successful information campaign (possibly consisting of several information projects) is greatly dependent on the overall credibility of central sources, public information releases, the channels used for transmission, and the diffusion of messages to psychologically affected masses. To manage these masses, disaster planners should consider goal group (see terminology) strategies. </p>
    <p>Credibility is the discriminating quality of an information source providing crucial information to a risk-prone group of more or less frightened people, and to some extent also of the medium used as channel between the source and the information receivers.</p>
<h3>Risk reduction measures</h3>    <p>These are various activities, projects and programs that the communities may identify after assessing and analyzing the risks that they face. These measures are specifically intended to reduce the current and prevent future risks in the community.</p>
<h3>Structural/non-structural measures</h3> <p>Structural measures refer to any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which include engineering measures and construction of hazard-resistant and protective structures and infrastructure. </p>
    <p>Non-structural measures refer to policies, awareness, knowledge development, public commitment, and methods and operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of information, which can reduce risk and related impacts.</p>
<h3>Sustainable development </h3>   <p>Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
    <p>It contains within it two key concepts: the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organisation on the environment's ability to meet present and the future needs. </p>
    <p>Sustainable development is based on socio-cultural development, political stability and decorum, economic growth and ecosystem protection, which all relate to disaster risk reduction. </p>
<h3>Technological hazards</h3>  <p>Danger originating from technological or industrial accidents, dangerous procedures, infrastructure failures or certain human activities, which may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. </p>
    <p>Some examples: industrial pollution, nuclear activities and radioactivity, toxic wastes, dam failures; transport, industrial or technological accidents (explosions, fires, spills).</p>
<h3>Vulnerability</h3>  <p>The conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors or processes, which increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards. </p>
    <p>For positive factors, which increase the ability of people to cope with hazards, see definition of capacity.</p>
<h3>Wildland fire</h3>  <p>Any fire occurring in vegetation areas regardless of ignition sources, damages or benefits.</p>
